     <div id="about-description">
        <p>Thorne & Spindle was conjured up from the abyss of extreme depression resulting post-finals. As the four were wallowing in their despair, drowning in fail-fail cake along with unnamed friends, they thought up of the original idea of selling apparel!
        </p>
        <p>Thorne & Spindle is based in Irvine, California and was built up from a basement clothing store to a street vendor shop to an online, baller clothing store. Due to its recent conception, circa 2016, the company is looking on for new hires to whip into shape.
